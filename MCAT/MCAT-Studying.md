Biology:

    Definitions:
        - Cartilage: firm, elastic, translucent connective tissue produced by chondrocyte cells; avascular
        - Hyaline Cartilage: most abundant cartilage in the body, found in tracheal, laryngeal structures, as well as the ribs and nose; provides attachment point for critical muscles.
        
        - Endoderm: inner most layer, develops into GI tract, liver, pancreas, parts of the lungs. 
        - Mesoderm: middle layer, develops into musculoskeletal system, circulatory system, internal sex organs.
        - Ectoderm: outer layer,  develops into skin, hair, nails, the neural crest, neural tube >> nervous system.

    Definitions:
        - Rate Law
            - expresses the relationship of the rate of a reaction to the rate constant and the consentrations of the reactants raised to some power.
                ''' aA + bB = cC + dD '''
                ''' Rate = (k) ([A]^x) ([B]^y) '''
                - reaction is "x" order w/ respect to a 
                - reaction is "y" order w/ respect to b 
            - "x" and "y" are called the orders for each reactant.
            - Rate constant "k" is a proportinality constant in the relationship between rate and consentrations..

        - Reaction Order
            - The order of a rate law is the sum of the exponents of its concentration terms.
