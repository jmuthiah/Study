    Definitions:
        - Cartilage: firm, elastic, translucent connective tissue produced by chondrocyte cells; avascular
        - Hyaline Cartilage: most abundant cartilage in the body, found in tracheal, laryngeal structures, as well as the ribs and nose; provides attachment point for critical muscles.
        
        - Endoderm: inner most layer, develops into GI tract, liver, pancreas, parts of the lungs. 
        - Mesoderm: middle layer, develops into musculoskeletal system, circulatory system, internal sex organs.
        - Ectoderm: outer layer,  develops into skin, hair, nails, the neural crest, neural tube >> nervous system.

Chemistry:
   
    Definitions:
        - Rate Law
            - expresses the relationship of the rate of a reaction to the rate constant and the consentrations of the reactants raised to some power.
                ''' aA + bB = cC + dD '''
                ''' Rate = (k) ([A]^x) ([B]^y) '''
                - reaction is "x" order w/ respect to a 
                - reaction is "y" order w/ respect to b 
            - "x" and "y" are called the orders for each reactant.
            - Rate constant "k" is a proportinality constant in the relationship between rate and consentrations..

        - Reaction Order
            - The order of a rate law is the sum of the exponents of its concentration terms.  

Biochemial Processes:
    Glycolysis Regulation:
        Glycolysis Steps:
            
            Step 1: Glucose -> Glucose-6-Phosphate (G6P) 
                via hexokinase: requires ATP -> ADP
                        rate limiting step

            Step 2: G6P <=> Fructose-6-Phosphate (F6P)
                via G6P Isomerase

            Step 3: F6P -> Fructose-1,6-Bisphosphate (F-1,6-P2)
                via phosphofrictokinase 1 (PFK-1): requires ATP -> ADP
                        rate limiting step
            
            Step 4: F-1,6-P2 => Dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DAP)
                        A
                        ||
                        V
                        Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate (GAP)
                both reactions are facilitated via Aldolyse 
                    GAP <=> DAP 
                        via triose phosphate isomerase
            
            Step 5: GAP <=> 1,3 Bisphosphoglycerate (1,3-BPG)
                via GAP dehydrogenase: requires NAD+ -> NADH + H+

            Step 6: 1,3-BPG <=> 3-phosphyglycerate
                via phosphoglycerate kinase: requires ADP -> ATP

            Step 7: 3-phosphyglycerate <=> 2-Phosphoglycerate 
                via phosphoglycerate mutase
            
            Step 8: 2-Phosphoglycerate <=> Phosphenol pyruvate
                via enolase; forward direction releases H2O molecule

            Step 9: Phosphenol Pyruvate -> Pyruvate 
                via Pyruvate Kinase: requires ADP -> ATP
                        rate limiting step
