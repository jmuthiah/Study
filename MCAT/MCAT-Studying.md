    Definitions:
        - Cartilage: firm, elastic, translucent connective tissue produced by chondrocyte cells; avascular
        - Hyaline Cartilage: most abundant cartilage in the body, found in tracheal, laryngeal structures, as well as the ribs and nose; provides attachment point for critical muscles.
        
        - Endoderm: inner most layer, develops into GI tract, liver, pancreas, parts of the lungs. 
        - Mesoderm: middle layer, develops into musculoskeletal system, circulatory system, internal sex organs.
        - Ectoderm: outer layer,  develops into skin, hair, nails, the neural crest, neural tube >> nervous system.

Chemistry:
   
    Definitions:
        - Rate Law
            - expresses the relationship of the rate of a reaction to the rate constant and the consentrations of the reactants raised to some power.
                ''' aA + bB = cC + dD '''
                ''' Rate = (k) ([A]^x) ([B]^y) '''
                - reaction is "x" order w/ respect to a 
                - reaction is "y" order w/ respect to b 
            - "x" and "y" are called the orders for each reactant.
            - Rate constant "k" is a proportinality constant in the relationship between rate and consentrations..

        - Reaction Order
            - The order of a rate law is the sum of the exponents of its concentration terms.  

Biochemial Processes:
    Glycolysis Steps:
        
        Step 1: Glucose -> Glucose-6-Phosphate (G6P) 
            via hexokinase: requires ATP -> ADP
                    rate limiting step

        Step 2: G6P <=> Fructose-6-Phosphate (F6P)
            via G6P Isomerase

        Step 3: F6P -> Fructose-1,6-Bisphosphate (F-1,6-P2)
            via phosphofrictokinase 1 (PFK-1): requires ATP -> ADP
                    rate limiting step
        
        Step 4: F-1,6-P2 => Dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DAP)
                    A
                    ||
                    V
                    Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate (GAP)
            both reactions are facilitated via Aldolyse 
                GAP <=> DAP 
                    via triose phosphate isomerase
        
        Step 5: GAP <=> 1,3 Bisphosphoglycerate (1,3-BPG)
            via GAP dehydrogenase: requires NAD+ -> NADH + H+

        Step 6: 1,3-BPG <=> 3-phosphyglycerate
            via phosphoglycerate kinase: requires ADP -> ATP

        Step 7: 3-phosphyglycerate <=> 2-Phosphoglycerate 
            via phosphoglycerate mutase
        
        Step 8: 2-Phosphoglycerate <=> Phosphenol pyruvate
            via enolase; forward direction releases H2O molecule

        Step 9: Phosphenol Pyruvate -> Pyruvate 
            via Pyruvate Kinase: requires ADP -> ATP
                    rate limiting step
        
    Regulatory Mecahnisms of Glycolysis
        Hormonal: 
            Via signaling molecules e.g. cAMP
        Allosteric
            Via regulatory molecules e.g. Reactants or Products
        
    Hexokinase Regulation:
        Hormonal: 
            Glucagon:
                inhibits transcription of hexokinase; therefore stops first step of glycolysis
                    blood glucose level increases
            Insulin: 
                facilitates activity of glucose transporters and transcription of hexokinase
                    blood glucose level decreases
        Allosteric:
            G6P:
                inhibits via binding to allosteric site, preventing further phosphorylation of glucose.

        Glucose Affinity of hexokinase

        | Enzyme      | Tissue         | GA   | Active @                               |
        | hexo IV     | hepatic        | Down | High Glucose Concen.                   | 
        | Hexokinase  | Extra hepatic  | Up   | Low Glucose Concen.                    |

    Phosphofructokinase 1 (PFK-1) inhibition:
        Inhibitors:
            ATP, Citrate, Protons
        ATP:   
            leads to inhibition because it cignals that cellular energy supply is sufficient; functions as inhibitor via allosteric binding causing __conformational change__ reducing enzyme's affinity to Fructose-6-Phosphate.
        Citrate:
            intermediate of the TCA (Krebs) cycle; accumulates if there is excess acetyl-CoA; works synergistically with ATP by binding to other active sites further stablizing PFK-1 in the low-affinity T State
        High H+ Concentration:
            pH decreases during downstream anaerobic metabolism of pyruvate. To prevent extreme/damaging conditions to the cell pyruvate production via glycolysis is inhibited at low pH. 
    PFK-1 Activation:
        Activators:
            AMP, F-2,6-P2
        AMP:
            AMP + ATP = 2 ADP
                The presence of AMP in the cell signifies that energy is required, Further illustrated by the above formula; AMP binds to a specific allosteric activator site of PFK-1; causing conformational change from __inactive T state__ to __active R state__; this increases affinity for F6P.
        Special Cases
            F-2,6-P2
                can function as activator or deactivator
            Liver:
                increased glucagon -> cAMP upregulation -> F-2,6-P2 downregulation -> downregulation of PFK-1
            Heart:
                increased adrenalin -> cAMP upregulation -> F-2,6-P2 upregulation -> upregulation of PFK-1
    Pyruvate Kinase Inhibition:
        Inhibitors: 
            ATP, Alanine (from pyruvate)
        ATP: 
            Presence of ATP signifies that energy requirements are already met.
        Alanine (from pyruvate):
            signals that substrate requirements of other metabolic pathys are covered.
    Pyruvate Kinase Activators:
        Activators:
            F-1,6-P2
        F-1,6-P2: 
            Feed-forward activatioin, allosteric
